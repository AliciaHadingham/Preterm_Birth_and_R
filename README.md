## Downloading R
To use R you need to:
* [Download R](https://www.r-project.org/)  
* [Download RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

Please see the PDF 'How_to_download_R_and_RStudio.pdf' for more details.
<br/><br/>

## The scripts
All scripts and data can be downloaded for you to practise coding in R.  <br/><br/>
You will need to change the working directory to the folder on your computer where you have put the data.
<br/><br/>

## The data 
The data folder contains the csv files we used in the tutorials. It also contains the data that you can use to help you in your final assignment/academic project. <br/><br/>
All data used in this course was fabricated. The data was made for the purpose of showing how R can be used in preterm birth or other medical research :hospital: :microscope: :syringe:
